# 🌱 Don't Touch Grass 🌱
## What does it do?
This mod detects when you touch grass, and when you do it force crashes your game. It's a very simple idea, but also very vital for those of us who are unemoployed and plan to stay that way! So if you'd like to stay unemployed, chronically online, and avoid showers, this is the mod for you! Have fun :D
